# BMVI DataRun evan.network

Within the 24 hours of the BMVI DataRun we have developed a decentralized application to visualize and enable different stakeholders to manage their digital identites which are currently represented by mFund data from the cambio carsharing data.

We have generated a digital identity for the available data on the ethereum based evan.network. Every identity has different data parts like approval status or general metadata provided by the manufaturer of the car. These data parts are only visible to the stakeholder which needs the data.

With this identity then it is possible to allow different services to consume or use different dataparts to enable different serivces (maintenance, insurance, banks) for the owner of the vehicle.

To get real time data we have used the streaming data from the mFUND project emily to visualize the current position of the vehicle which can only be viewed by the owner itself.

For example a damage is registered on the car, it travels automatically to the maintenence provider and he registers the needed repair steps on the vehicle logbook. Then the insurance company gets the informations about the damage on the car and can start the damage regulation for the owner of the vehicle. Also if the vehicle is (for example) financed by a bank, the bank must give the okay for the regulation and the cash flow.

All these different stakeholders have their own view to the data of the vehicle and the owner of the car has the data sovereignty of the registered data of his vehicle.
