# BMVI DataRun evan.network

Within the 24 hours of the BMVI DataRun we have developed a decentralized application to visualize and enable different stakeholders to manage their digital identities which are currently represented by mFund data from the cambio car sharing data.

We have generated a digital identity for the available data on the Ethereum based evan.network. Every identity has different data parts like approval status or general metadata provided by the manufacturer of the car. These data parts are only visible to the stakeholder which needs the data.

With this identity it is possible to allow different services to consume or use different data parts to enable different services (maintenance, insurance, banks) for the owner of the vehicle.

To get real time data we have used the streaming data from the mFUND project emily to visualize the current position of the vehicle which can only be viewed by the owner itself.

For example a damage is registered on the car, it travels automatically to the maintenance provider which registers the needed repair steps on the vehicle logbook. Then the insurance company gets the information about the damage on the car and can start the damage regulation for the owner of the vehicle. Also if the vehicle is (for example) financed by a bank, the bank must give the okay for the regulation and the cash flow.

All these different stakeholders have their own view to the data of the vehicle and the owner of the car has the data sovereignty of the registered data of his vehicle.
